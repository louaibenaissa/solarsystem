#### Project Overview
This project simulates the movements of the moon and planets within the solar system. It employs numerical solutions to differential equations. The simulation utilizes four methods: Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta methods (of orders 2 and 4), and the Finite Differences Method. 

The project includes the `support.py` file (which contains the supporting functions) and the `project.ipynb` notebook for running the simulations.
